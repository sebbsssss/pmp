/**
 * Standalone verifier helpers.
 *
 * The PmpClient.verify() method calls a provider's /verify endpoint, which
 * recomputes the hash + does the chain lookup server-side. These helpers
 * provide a *client-side* recompute so a caller can independently verify
 * a Memory blob without trusting the provider's recompute.
 *
 * Useful for:
 *   - Caching: verify once, store result, skip future round-trips.
 *   - Air-gapped audit: confirm a memory matches its attestation offline.
 *   - Cross-provider checks: same memory under two providers should hash the same.
